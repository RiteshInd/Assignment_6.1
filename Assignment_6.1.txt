1. Use the given link and locate the bank marketing dataset. Data Set Link:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
Perform the below operations:


library(readr) 
bank_full <- read_delim("D:/R/bank-full.csv", ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
str(bank_full)


a. Create a visual for representing missing values in the dataset.

require(Amelia)
missmap(bank_full,main="Missing Data - Bank ", 
	col=c("red","grey"),legend=FALSE)
summary(bank_full)

## No red colour stripes are visible. hence no missing values.

b. Show a distribution of clients based on a Job.

## Barplots for Categorical Variables 
barplot(table(bank_full$job),col="red",main="JOB")
barplot(table(bank_full$marital),col="green",main="Marital")
barplot(table(bank_full$education),col="blue",main="Education")

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off 
barplot(table(bank_full$job),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$job", 
	border="black", col="grey",las=2)

#Histogram for job,marital and education - three categorical variables 
par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off 
barplot(table(bank_full$job),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$job", 
	border="yellow", col="violet",las=2)

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off 
barplot(table(bank_full$marital),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$marital", 
	border="green", col="yellow",las=2)

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off 
barplot(table(bank_full$education),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$education", 
	border="red", col="blue",las=2)



c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status?


# As both are a categorical variable this can be checked with chisq.test 

library("MASS")
with(bank_full, chisq.test( job, marital))

with(bank_full, table( job, marital) )

# OR 

with(bank_full, prop.table(table( job,marital)))

#<2.2e-16 means 0.00000000000000022. It is (very much) less than 0.05



d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?

As both are a categorical variable this can be checked with chisq.test 

library("MASS")

with(bank_full, chisq.test( job,education))

with(bank_full, table( job, education) )

# OR 

with(bank_full, prop.table(table( job,education)))

#<2.2e-16 means 0.00000000000000022. It is (very much) less than 0.05
